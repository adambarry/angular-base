#DAM (Digital Asset Management)

##Getting started
Once you've pulled the code repository from Git, run the following commands from a console to get up and running:

1. `npm install` to install the Node dependencies for the project.
- `bower install` to install the project's frontend dependencies.
-  `grunt watch` which will initially concatenate the JavaScript files and compile the LESS files into CSS which the browser can interpret.
